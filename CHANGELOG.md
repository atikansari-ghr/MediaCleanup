# Changelog

All notable changes to MediaCleanup are documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Configurable target languages** — `[languages] targets` in `MediaCleanup.toml` (ISO codes or English names, ~40 languages built in). List order controls the output audio track order. Default remains Hindi/English/Telugu.
- **Video track language fix** — the video track (usually `und`) is stamped with the title's original language from TMDB during tag cleaning; `--force-video-lang` overrides.
- **Cover art in the main pipeline** — `--movies`/`--tv` now finish each file completely: remux, tags + metadata, FileBot rename, and cover art embed (ledger-backed; `--skip-coverart` to disable).
- Committed `runtimes\` folder skeleton with a setup guide; relative TOML paths resolve against the script folder for clone-and-go setup.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-08

First public release.

### Added

**Core pipelines**
- Movie pipeline: groups variant releases of the same movie by filename similarity, selects the best video track (HEVC preferred), collects **all** Hindi/English/Telugu audio tracks from every variant, keeps target-language subtitles (regular + SDH), and merges everything into one clean MKV.
- TV pipeline: same track selection and cleanup per episode file.
- Skip-remux fast path: files that already contain only target-language audio are tagged and renamed in place — no unnecessary remux.
- Safety model: working-copy mirroring (sources never modified by the remux path), atomic temp-file writes, `--dry-run` preview for every mode.

**Standalone modes**
- `--cleantags` — strips promotional/watermark tags and attachments in place; with API keys configured, embeds full metadata (genre, director, writers, top-10 cast with characters, synopsis, certification, IMDB rating, franchise collection; TV show/season/episode tag levels) from TMDB + OMDb.
- `--coverart` — embeds posters as MKV cover art via a local-file → TMDB → fanart.tv → OMDb chain with English-first poster language; per-run HTML review gallery and audit copies; persistent ledger so completed files are skipped instantly (`--coverart-overwrite` to redo).
- `--rename` / `--rename-undo` — FileBot renaming of messy downloads into the canonical format, with noise-stripped lookup queries, optional library organization (`--rename-into`), a full history CSV, and one-command undo.
- `--subtitles` — downloads missing subtitles from OpenSubtitles.com as sidecar `.srt` files (moviehash + IMDB matching, quota-aware, configurable languages).

**Quality of life**
- `MediaCleanup.toml` configuration — no hardcoded paths; git-ignored (API keys stay private) with a committed example template.
- `--filter` — case-insensitive glob scoping (folder or filename) for every mode.
- `--validate-keys` — one-call verification of all configured API keys.
- Colored log output and end-of-run summary tables when [rich](https://pypi.org/project/rich/) is installed (`--no-color` to disable).
- Documentation set: usage guide, configuration reference, illustrated README.
